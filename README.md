## Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** [10/19/2024]

Welcome to [SparkAI] (“we,” “our,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our dating app (the "App"). We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring compliance with all relevant privacy laws, including Apple's iOS guidelines and intellectual property laws.

### 1. **Information We Collect**

When you use [SparkAI], we may collect the following types of personal data:

- **Image Data:** The App requires users to upload a photo. This image is processed to generate a customized interaction (“rizz response”) based on visual features. We do not store the image beyond the necessary period to complete this functionality.
- **Profile Data:** You may provide additional information, such as your name, age, gender, and location, to personalize your experience on the App.
- **Interaction Data:** Information about your use of the App, including the generated responses and user preferences, may be collected for analytics and app improvement purposes.
- **Device Data:** We collect data about your device, including device model, operating system, IP address, and unique device identifiers (UDIDs), for security and app performance purposes.

### 2. **How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
- **Image Processing:** To generate personalized responses based on your image input.
- **App Functionality:** To personalize your user experience and provide relevant content.
- **Analytics and Improvements:** To analyze usage patterns and improve the App’s features and performance.
- **Compliance and Security:** To ensure compliance with legal obligations, Apple’s iOS guidelines, and to protect against fraud and abuse.

### 3. **Data Retention**

We do not retain your images after they have been processed. All image data is deleted immediately once the rizz response has been generated. Other information, such as usage data, may be retained for a longer period in compliance with legal requirements and to improve the App’s performance.

### 4. **Sharing Your Information**

We will not sell, lease, or share your personal information with third parties, except:
- **With your consent.**
- **For legal reasons**, including complying with court orders or applicable laws.
- **To service providers** who assist in operating the App under strict data protection agreements.

### 5. **User Consent and Data Control**

By using the App, you consent to the collection, use, and processing of your data as outlined in this Privacy Policy. You may withdraw your consent at any time by deleting the App or contacting us at [SparkAI@gmail.com].

### 6. **Intellectual Property Compliance**

Our App respects intellectual property laws and all user-generated content, including images, remains the property of the user. By uploading an image, you grant us a non-exclusive license to use the image solely for the purpose of generating the rizz response.

We do not use or store user images for any purpose beyond providing the immediate service. Any reuse or sharing of third-party content, including text or images, complies with Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines and relevant IP laws.

### 7. **Security**

We use encryption and other appropriate security measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

### 8. **Apple's Guidelines and Compliance**

[SparkAI] complies with all of Apple’s App Store Guidelines, including:

- **User Data Collection:** We collect only the necessary information to provide the App’s core functionalities, and we give users control over their data.
- **Third-Party Access:** We do not share user data with third parties unless explicitly stated in this policy or required by law.
- **Parental Controls:** Users under the age of 17 are required to obtain parental consent, in accordance with Apple’s guidelines.

### 9. **Your Rights**

You have the right to:
- **Access, update, or delete** your personal data.
- **Withdraw consent** for data collection at any time.
- **Complain** to a data protection authority if you feel your privacy rights have been violated.

To exercise your rights, contact us at [SparkAI@gmail.com].

### 10. **Changes to the Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted within the App, and your continued use of the App will signify your acceptance of the updated terms.
